// SCALING OPTIONS
// scaling can have values as follows with full being the default
// FIT		sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit inside window size
// FILL		sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fill window size
// FULL		sets stage to window size with no scaling
// "tagID"	add canvas to HTML tag of ID - set to dimensions if provided - no scaling

var scaling = "full"; // makes stage the window size but does not scale content
var color = yellow; // zim colors are now available globally 

var frame = new Frame(scaling, null, null, color); // see docs for more options and info
frame.on("ready", function() {
	zog("ready from ZIM Frame");
	
	const stage = frame.stage;
	const stageW = frame.width;
	const stageH = frame.height;

	// put your code here (you can delete this code)

	const button = new Button(140, 60, "ZIM", dark, grey);
	// will position and scale the code in the resize function at bottom
	button.on("click", function() { // on() is like addEventListener()
		zgo("http://zimjs.com/frame.html"); // or relative URL, target is available too
	});

	// put resizing code in here
	// resize also gets called initially
	frame.on("resize", resize);
	function resize(e) {
		//stageW = frame.width;
		//stageH = frame.height;
		// can redraw things at different sizes or use scaling here
		button.scaleTo(stage, 20); // also see zim.Layout() for more complex scaling
		button.center(); // centers on stage - addTo() and others as well!
		stage.update();
	}
	resize();

}); // end of ready
